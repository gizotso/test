    "Markdown supports two styles for creating links: inline and reference. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the text you want to turn into a link.\n",

    "\n",
    "<p>This is an <a href=\"http://example.com/\">\n",

    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This is an <a href=\"http://example.com/\" title=\"With a Title\">\n",
    "example link</a>.</p>\n",
    "Reference-style links allow you to refer to your links by names, which you define elsewhere in your document:\n",
    "\n",
    "I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from\n",
    "[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].\n",
    "\n",
    "[1]: http://google.com/        \"Google\"\n",

    "CODE\n",
    "\n",
    "In a regular paragraph, you can create code span by wrapping text in backtick quotes. Any ampersands (&) and angle brackets (< or >) will automatically be translated into HTML entities. This makes it easy to use Markdown to write about HTML example code:\n",
